# Restake-UI

Restake UI app is available [here](https://restake.cogwheel.zone).

Restake UI is a fork from [here](https://github.com/eco-stake/restake-ui). It's an
app enabling you to stake, vote, activate restake, and manage and create new grants.
The app includes all Cosmos-based chains, displaying those with a restake option.

## Tutorial: Basic Actions

This section guides you on delegating, activating restake, and revoking grants.
Creating new grants is an advanced feature, recommended for experienced users.

### Staking

1. Select the blockchain to delegate your assets.
2. Connect your wallet (Keplr, Leap, Cosmostation).
3. Choose the validator to stake with.
4. Press "View," switch to "Stake, tab" and select "Delegate."
5. Insert the staking amount and confirm the transaction.

Example that we used here is for Dyson Protocol but it should be the same for every other chain.
