# Blockchain Explorer

Explore the blockchain with our user-friendly tool available at 
[this link](https://explorer.cogwheel.zone).

## Understanding the Blockchain Explorer

A blockchain explorer is a powerful tool that allows you to delve into blockchain data, 
review past transactions, examine on-chain data, observe validators securing the network, 
and more. Our blockchain explorer is a customized version derived from the open-source ping.pub 
explorer project, which you can find [here](https://github.com/ping-pub/explorer). What sets our 
explorer apart is its unique features, such as the ability to stake and send assets directly from 
the explorer, participate in governance proposals, create CosmWasm smart contracts (on supported 
chains), and more!

With this explorer, you can:

- Stake assets
- Send assets
- Swap assets (currently in a very experimental phase)
- Create CosmWasm smart contracts
- Search for previous transactions
- Monitor validator uptime
- Explore blockchain parameters
