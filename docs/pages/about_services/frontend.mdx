# Frontend page

Dyson Frontend is available [here](https://dys.cogwheel.zone)

Dyson Frontend is a app that gives option for developers to develop and deploy WDapps
all on the Dyson Protocol's blockchain. You can develop and deploy python scripts which
can be made and used for different purposes. The most powerfull tool is WSGI. For
example you can deploy whole website using python WSGI. You can buy on chain name and 
your service can be seen on our domain. For example if you bought name mike anyone could
access it on mike.cogwheel.zone. Or if any other validator has deployed Dyson Frontend you
could access it from their domain.
