# Blockchain Explorer

Explore the blockchain with our user-friendly tool available at 
[this link](https://explorer.cogwheel.zone).

## Understanding the Blockchain Explorer

A blockchain explorer is a powerful tool that allows you to delve into blockchain data, 
review past transactions, examine on-chain data, observe validators securing the network, 
and more. Our blockchain explorer is a customized version derived from the open-source ping.pub 
explorer project, which you can find [here](https://github.com/ping-pub/explorer). What sets our 
explorer apart is its unique features, such as the ability to stake and send assets directly from 
the explorer, participate in governance proposals, create CosmWasm smart contracts (on supported 
chains), and more!

With this explorer, you can:

- Stake assets
- Send assets
- Swap assets (currently in a very experimental phase)
- Create CosmWasm smart contracts
- Search for previous transactions
- Monitor validator uptime
- Explore blockchain parameters

## Tutorial: The Basic

In this section you will learn how to do basic actions inside our 
explorer. 

### Connect your wallet

In order to do anything you will need to connect your wallet. To 
connect your wallet press litle wallet icon in the top right corner.

![Connect wallet](./assets/connectWallet.webp)
![Select your wallet](./assets/selectWallet.webp)

From here you can chose between multiple wallets: Keplr, Leap, 
Metamask and Ledger. If it does not connect you will 
need to manually add chain to your wallet \(this is only needed for 
Keplr wallet\)

![Blockchain not found](./assets/addBlockchain.webp)
![Add blockchain](./assets/addTheChain.webp)

If there is an error it will probably look like this. 
Press on `suggest a chain for Keplr` and it will prompt you to another 
page where you will need to select which chain to add to Keplr.
When you are ready press the button `add chain to Keplr`.

### Send assets to another address on the same network

After you have sucessufully connected your wallet select the blockchain 
you want to send tokens from. Go to the dashboard and your wallet will 
should be connected. In this section you will see `More` in the right 
corner. Select it and it will transfer you to your account page. Press 
option send and a window will pop up. 

![Pop up send assets](./assets/sendAssets.webp)

From there select asset you want to send to another wallet 
on the same network. Enter the address and click send. After that
a popup from your wallet will show. Confirm the transaction and it
will execute in a couple of secounds.

### Send assets to another network via IBC

From the same page select transfer button. A pop up window will show.

![Pop up send assets via IBC](./assets/sendAssetsIBC.webp)

From there select asset you want to send. Select to which chain you
want to send the token to. Fill out the amount and the address.
After that confirm the transaction and sign it with your wallet.

### Stake assets

First select the blockchain you want to partake in staking
then go to `staking` tab. After that you will find a list of all 
active validators. Do your own reaserch to which validator will you
stake. 

![Select validator](./assets/stake.webp)

When you made up your mind select delegate, fill out the amount you 
want to stake and then press send. A pop up window from your wallet
will show and you will need to sign the transaction.
import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If you can't decide to whom you want to delegate you can delegate
  to multiple validators. You will just need to repeat staking process
  for each validator.
</Callout>

### Monitor validator uptime

While this might not be very effective way of monitorng validator it
could give you basic information about how many block are missed in
one block window for all of the current active validators. Select the
blockchain you want to inspect. Then swich to `uptime` tab. From there
you can see how much are validators missing blocks. 

![Uptime screen](./assets/uptime.webp)

You can select customize option and add validator you want to monitor.
Just select the network and validator you want to monitor.
